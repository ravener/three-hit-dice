# Three Hit Dice
This is a very simple CLI for playing [Three Hit Dice](https://kakegurui.fandom.com/wiki/Three_Hit_Dice) from the series Kakegurui Twin.

## Usage
You will need `git` and `python` installed:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ravener/three-hit-dice
$ cd three-hit-dice
$ python main.py
```

The game is designed to be played with 2 Players in real life.

The game asks for the first player's guess and after they press enter the screen is cleared to keep their guess a secret, now the second player may look at the screen and enter their guess, again after them pressing enter the screen is cleared. Now when both players are ready pressing another enter will start rolling the dices after a delay between them, now just watch as you await your guess to appear.

## The Future
I've become obsessed with Kakegurui that I'd like to keep experimenting with ideas trying to implement their games, this is a yet another basic attempt after I did [Nim Zero](https://github.com/ravener/nim-zero), in the future I may do more like adding a graphical frontend, online multiplayer, discord bots or whatever ideas come.
